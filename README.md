Project #1 of the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

--> Starting from a starter code, the goal was to add code to parse sandwich data from a JSON object locally available in the strings.xml file. It was also asked to write all necessary code to display correctly the sandwich data in a detail activity.
